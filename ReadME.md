Brain Tumor Classifier - ReadME
Project Overview
This project involves building a brain tumor classification model using deep learning.
The model has been trained to detect brain tumors based on medical images. This ReadMe outlines
the steps involved in training, saving, and utilizing the model, as well as details about additional
objects saved in the process.
Instructions
1. **Training the Model**:
Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed, like TensorFlow and Keras.
```python
# Import necessary libraries
import tensorflow as tf
# Build and train your model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([...])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))
```
2. **Saving the Model**:
Once the model is trained, you can save it in the HDF5 format.
```python
model_path = '/path/to/save/brain_tumor_model.h5'
model.save(model_path) # Save the model
```
3. **Saving Additional Objects (Optional)**:
If you have additional preprocessing objects like a label encoder or a scaler, save them using Pickle.
```python
import pickle
# Example objects (replace with actual objects)
objects_to_save = {
 'label_encoder': label_encoder,
 'scaler': scaler
}
# Save the objects
with open('/path/to/save/brain_tumor_objects.pkl', 'wb') as file:
 pickle.dump(objects_to_save, file)
```
4. **Loading the Model and Objects**:
When you need to use the model again, load it along with the saved objects:
```python
# Load the model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('/path/to/save/brain_tumor_model.h5')
# Load the additional objects
with open('/path/to/save/brain_tumor_objects.pkl', 'rb') as file:
 objects = pickle.load(file)
label_encoder = objects['label_encoder']
scaler = objects['scaler']
```
